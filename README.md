# Mission-to-Mars
## A Web Scraping Challenge

### Background
We are now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project for the mission to Mars. This challenge will use Jupyter Notebook to scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize data from two websites. The code used will showcase knowledge previously learned in collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating insights.

### Deliverables
This new assignment consists of two technical products:
- Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from [Mars news articles](https://redplanetscience.com/).
- Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze [Mars weather data](https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html), which exists in a table.
